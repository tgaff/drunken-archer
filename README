Hi, this sample app is prepared to give you a chance to fix a few quick bugs. 
The tests here were all working, prior to a change I made: I switched capybara to using selenium.  
Unfortunately that broke a lot of things.  Please help me fix them!   (and not by reverting my change ^_^ )

To get you started please run: 
  cucumber -r features features/visitors/request_invitation.feature -l 18

If you don't want to work on that one, check out any of the other broken tests.
  cucumber

Or maybe write a test to check some of the links on the home page. (google, yahoo, bing...)

Thanks!
